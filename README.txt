Code Louisville Assignment

Your mini weekly challenge: Create a basic web page (or use an existing project) using HTML and CSS. Attach a separate JS file. In that file, define a variable that is an Array containing at least 5 Objects worth of data. This data can be anything - get it from online or come up with your own data - but it must be an array with at least 5 objects therein. Loop through ("iterate") the array and display some of the values dynamically on your page. When you have done this right, you should be able to change/update the data array, refresh the page, and see the new data displayed on the page.
